compression algorithm ideas:
store K/V of word to indices of appearences; skip words < 3 chars and words who's compressed bytesize is greater than uncompressed
convert all chars to ints and then find function that fits ints as data points - the hard part is then knowing which x values to feed into the function to get back the chars. if  you have a 1-1 ratio of x values on f(x) to a given char, you're not compressing. if you use words instead of chars, you run into similar problems as the idea above.
